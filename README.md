## Summary
This is a tool created using the **openlibrary.org API** which allows users to request an ISBN from the API to get relevant information such as title, author, and publisher. The tool will **save data to a JSON file** and displayes all saved books on the **frontend built using tkinter**.

## Objective
My goal was to learn the essentials for using APIs and how to best parse the information received from an API request. Additionally, I wanted to make it so the program felt like something I would actually use so I built it with a frontend rather than being another project which operates in the terminal. I can now use this to save textbooks for my future college courses!

## Difficulties and Challenges
Learning how to request from an API wasn't too difficult. I found that it took a little bit of learning how to properly read the information given from an API request but it overall wasn't too bad. The harder part came from handling cases in which a request didn't have all the information (e.g. the title and author were returned but there was no publisher).

## Key Takeaways/Learning Opportunities
I learned a lot while creating this project. I've learned that my best approach is to create a todo list with small achievable and realistic goals to create the most efficient roadmap in completing the project. This is especially important when there's multiple components and technologies working together i.e. API, JSON, and tkinter.
